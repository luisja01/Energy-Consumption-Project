 # Energy Demand Prediction Using Advanced Time Series Methods
Energy consumption varies due to multiple factors: seasonality, day of the week, peak usage patterns, weather conditions, and more. Accurately forecasting future energy demand is essential to:

* Plan energy production and distribution.
* Stabilize the power grid and avoid unexpected peaks (blackouts or extra costs).
* Reduce carbon footprint by integrating renewable energy sources more efficiently and minimizing the use of pollutant sources.

**Main Objective**  
Develop one or more predictive models that can estimate future energy demand (e.g., for the following hours or days) with high accuracy
